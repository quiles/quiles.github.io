However, this approach has limitations or can even yield incorrect interpretations. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the two components of the MSE, i.e., the bias and variance, using the QM9 data set. To this end, we experiment with three descriptors, namely (i) symmetry functions (SF, with two-body and three-body functions), (ii) many-body tensor representation (MBTR, with two- and three-body terms), and (iii) smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP), to evaluate the prediction process’s performance using different numbers of molecules in training samples and the effect of bias and variance on the final MSE. Overall, low sample sizes are related to higher MSE. Moreover, the bias component strongly influences the larger MSEs. Furthermore, there is little agreement among molecules with higher errors (outliers) across different descriptors. However, there is a high prevalence among the outliers intersection set and the convex hull volume of geometric coordinates (VCH). According to the obtained results with the distribution of MSE (and its components bias and variance) and the appearance of outliers, it is suggested to use ensembles of models with a low bias to minimize the MSE, more specifically when using a small number of molecules in the training set.","tags":["Machine Learning in Chemistry"],"title":"Systematic Investigation of Error Distribution in Machine Learning Algorithms Applied to the Quantum-Chemistry QM9 Data Set Using the Bias and Variance Decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Hild Aono","Ricardo José Gonzaga Pimenta","Ana Letycia Basso Garcia","Fernando Henrique Correr","Guilherme Kenichi Hosaka","Marishani Marin Carrasco","Cláudio Benício Cardoso-Silva","Melina Cristina Mancini","Danilo Augusto Sforça","Lucas Borges dos Santos","James Shiniti Nagai","Luciana Rossini Pinto","Marcos Guimarães de Andrade Landell","Monalisa Sampaio Carneiro","Thiago Willian Balsalobre","Marcos G.

The Sbi kinome was composed of 1,210 PKs; for Ssp, we identified 2,919 PKs when disregarding duplications and allelic copies, and these were related to 1,345 representative gene models. The Ssp and Sbi PKs were grouped into 20 groups and 120 subfamilies and exhibited high compositional similarities and evolutionary divergences. By utilizing the collinearity between the species, this study offers insights into Sbi and Ssp speciation, PK differentiation and selection. We assessed the PK subfamily expression profiles via RNA-Seq and identified significant similarities between Sbi and Ssp. Moreover, coexpression networks allowed inference of a core structure of kinase interactions with specific key elements. This study provides the first categorization of the allelic specificity of a kinome and offers a wide reservoir of molecular and genetic information, thereby enhancing the understanding of Sbi and Ssp PK evolutionary history.","tags":["Community Detection"],"title":"The Wild Sugarcane and Sorghum Kinomes: Insights Into Expansion, Diversification, and Expression Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jéssica Lamosa","Lívia R.

For the analyzes, we use a mobility database with a high temporal resolution. Our case study is the city of São José dos Campos (Brazil)—the city is divided into 55 traffic zones. More than 20 thousand people were asked about their travels the day before the survey (Origin-Destination Survey). We generated a set of graphs, where each vertex represents a traffic zone, and the edges are weighted by the number of trips between them, restricted to a time window. We calculated topological properties, such as degree, clustering coefficient and diameter, and the network’s community structure. The results show spatially concise community structures related to geographical factors such as highways and the persistence of some communities for different timestamps. These analyses may support the definition and adjustment of public policies to improve urban mobility. For instance, the community structure of the network might be useful for defining inter-zone public transportation.","tags":["Community Detection"],"title":"Topological indexes and community structure for urban mobility networks: Variations in a business day","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alessandra.marli","Tiago Silva da Silva","Elbert E.

In this work, we employed density functional theory calculations to address this problem using CO adsorption on 13-atom transition-metal clusters, TM13, namely, nCO/TM13, where TM = Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag, and n = 1–6. Unexpectedly, changes in the relative stability take place for all systems at a lower coverage, namely, at n = 3 (Ru13), 4 (Rh13, Ag13), and 2 (Pd13). To address the effects that lead to changes in the stability, we proposed an energy decomposition scheme for the binding energy of the nCO/TM13 systems, which yields that the change in relative stability is dominated by the interaction energy and cluster distortion energy upon adsorption, where the interaction energy is higher for high-energy unprotected clusters. Furthermore, we characterized all adsorption parameters, which helps us to complement our atomistic understanding.","tags":["Data Analysis"],"title":"Energy Decomposition to Access the Stability Changes Induced by CO Adsorption on Transition-Metal 13-Atom Clusters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johnatan Mucelini","Marcos G.

In this work, we introduce a data mining framework to accelerate the extraction of insights from QC datasets, which starts with a featurization process that converts atomic features into molecular properties (AtoMF). Then, it employs correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall) to investigate the AtoMF features relationship with a target property. We applied our framework to investigate three nanocluster systems, namely, PtnTM55–n, CenZr15–nO30, and (CHn + mH)/TM13. We found several interesting and consistent insights using Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients, indicating that they are suitable for our approach; however, our results indicate that the Pearson coefficient is very sensitive to outliers and should not be used. Moreover, we highlight problems that can occur during this analysis and discuss how to handle them.

The spread of rumors, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories online is evident in times of crisis, when fake news ramped up across platforms, increasing fear and confusion among the population as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores fact-checking initiatives in Latin America, using an original Markov-based computational method to cluster topics on tweets and identify their diffusion between different datasets. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our article proposes an in-depth tracing of COVID-related false information across the region, comparing if there is a pattern of behavior through the countries. We rely on the open Twitter application programming interface connection to gather data from public accounts of the six major fact-checking agencies in Latin America, namely Argentina (Chequeado), Brazil (Agência Lupa), Chile (Mala Espina Check), Colombia (Colombia Check from Consejo de Redacciín), Mexico (El Sabueso from Animal Polótico) and Venezuela (Efecto Cocuyo). In total, these profiles account for 102,379 tweets that were collected between January and July 2020. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of online information dissemination beyond the national level and demonstrates how politics intertwine with the health crisis in this period. Our method is capable of clustering topics in a period of overabundance of information, as we fight not only a pandemic but also an infodemic, evidentiating opportunities to understand and slow the spread of false information.","tags":["Social Networks"],"title":"COVID-19 fake news diffusion across Latin America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["wilson.ceron","Mathias-Felipe de Lima-Santos","Marcos G.

It is even more evident in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Fact-checking efforts have significantly expanded and have been touted as among the most promising solutions to fake news. Several studies have reported the development of fact-checking organizations in Western societies, albeit little attention has been given to the Global South. Here, to fill this gap, we introduce a novel Markov-inspired computational method for identifying topics in tweets. In contrast to other topic modeling approaches, our method clusters topics and their current evolution in a predefined time window. To conduct our experiments, we collected data from Twitter accounts of two Brazilian fact-checking outlets and presented the topics debunked by these initiatives in fortnights throughout the pandemic. By comparing these organizations, we could identify similarities and differences in what was shared by them. Our method resulted in an important technique to cluster topics in a wide range of scenarios, including an infodemic – a period overabundance of the same information. In particular, our results revealed a complex intertwining between politics and the health crisis during this period. We conclude by proposing a novel method which, in our opinion, is suitable for topic modeling and also an agenda for future research.","tags":["Social Networks"],"title":"Fake news agenda in the era of COVID-19: Identifying trends through fact-checking content","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
